        <p align="justify">
	  The <b>HyperText Markup Language</b> or <b>HTML</b> is the standard <em>markup language</em> for documents designed to be displayed in a 
	  <em>web browser</em>. It can be assisted by technologies such as <em>Cascading Style Sheets</em> (CSS) and <em>scripting languages</em> such 
	  as <em>JavaScript</em>.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  <em>Web browsers</em> receive HTML documents from a <em>web server</em> or from local storage and <em>render</em> the documents into multimedia 
	  web pages. HTML describes the structure of a <em>web page semantically</em> and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  <em>HTML elements</em> are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, <em>images</em> and other objects such as <em>interactive 
	  forms</em> may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create <em>structured documents</em> by denoting structural 
	  <em>semantics</em> for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, <em>links</em>, quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, 
	  written using <em>angle brackets</em>. Tags such as <code>&ltimg /&gt</code> and <code>&ltinput /&gt</code> directly introduce content into the 
	  page. Other tags such as <code>&ltp&gt</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
	  Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  HTML can embed programs written in a <em>scripting language</em> such as <em>JavaScript</em>, which affects the behavior and content of web pages.
	  The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The <em>World Wide Web Consortium</em> (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML 
	  and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, 
	  known as <em>HTML5</em>, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the <code>&ltcanvas&gt</code> element, in collaboration with javascript. 
        </p>

	<h2 id="history">History</h2>
	<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
	<p align="justify">
	  In 1980, <em>physicist Tim Berners-Lee</em>, a contractor at <em>CERN</em>, proposed and prototyped <em>ENQUIRE</em>, a system for CERN researchers 
	  to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <em>Internet</em>-based <em>hypertext</em> system. Berners-Lee specified 
	  HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN <em>data systems</em> engineer <em>Robert Cailliau</em> 
	  collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes from 1990 he listed "some of 
	  the many areas in which hypertext is used" and put an <em>encyclopedia</em> first.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called <em>"HTML Tags"</em>, first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in 
	  late 1991. It describes 18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly 
	  influenced by <em>SGMLguid</em>, an in-house <em>Standard Generalized Markup Language</em> (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of 
	  these elements still exist in HTML 4.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
	  HTML is a <em>markup language</em> that <em>web browsers</em> use to interpret and <em>compose text</em>, images, and other material into visual or 
	  audible web pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or 
	  enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <em>CSS</em>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 
	  Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <em>RUNOFF command</em> 
	  developed in the early 1960s for the <em>CTSS</em> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from 
  	  the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested 
	  annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively 
	  moved in this direction with CSS.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the <em>Internet Engineering Task Force</em> (IETF) 
	  with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet Draft by Berners-Lee 
	  and <em>Dan Connolly</em>, which included an SGML <em>Document type definition</em> to define the grammar. The draft expired after six months, but 
	  was notable for its acknowledgment of the <em>NCSA Mosaic</em> browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy 
	  of basing standards on successful prototypes. Similarly, <em>Dave Raggett</em>'s competing Internet-Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", 
	  from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed "HTML 2.0", the first HTML 
	  specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been maintained, 
	  with input from commercial software vendors, by the <em>World Wide Web Consortium</em> (W3C). However, in 2000, HTML also became an international 
	  standard (<em>ISO</em>/<em>IEC</em> 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001. In 2004, 
	  development began on HTML5 in the <em>Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group</em> (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable with the 
	  W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28 October 2014.

	<h4>HTML 2</h4>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>November 24, 1995</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">HTML 2.0 was published as <em>RFC 1866</em>. Supplemental <em>RFCs</em> added capabilities:</p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px">
	  <ul>
	    <li>November 25, 1995: <em>RFC 1867</em> (form-based file upload)</li>
	    <li>May 1996: <em>RFC 1942</em> (tables)</li>
	    <li>August 1996: <em>RFC 1980</em> (client-side image maps)</li>
	    <li>January 1997: <em>RFC 2070</em> (<em>internationalization</em>)</li>
	  </ul> 
	</p>
	<h4>HTML 3</h4>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>January 14, 1997</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
	  HTML 3.2 was published as a <em>W3C Recommendation</em>. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF 
	  had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:20px" align="justify">
	  Initially code-named "Wilbur", HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of 
	  <em>Netscape</em>'s visual markup tags. Netscape's <em>blink element</em> and <em>Microsoft</em>'s <em>marquee element</em> were omitted due to a 
	  mutual agreement between the two companies. A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later 
	  in <em>MathML</em>.
	</p>
	<h4>HTML 4</h4>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>December 18, 1997</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px">
	  HTML 4.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers three variations:
	  <ul>
	    <li>Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden</li>
	    <li>Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed</li>
	    <li>Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are allowed.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
	  Initially code-named "Cougar", HTML 4.0 adopted many browser-specific element types and attributes, but at the same time sought to phase out 
	  Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as <em>deprecated</em> in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application conforming to 
	  ISO 8879 – SGML.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>April 24, 1998</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
	  HTML 4.0 was reissued with minor edits without incrementing the version number.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>December 24, 1999</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
	  HTML 4.01 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last <em>errata</em> were published 
	  on May 12, 2001.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>May 2000</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px" align="justify">
	  ISO/IEC 15445:2000 ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard. In the ISO this standard falls 
	  in the domain of the <em>ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34</em> (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document description and processing 
	  languages). After HTML 4.01, there was no new version of HTML for many years as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML 
	  occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group through the early and mid-2000s.
	</p>
	<h4>HTML 5</h4>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>October 28, 2014</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px">
	  HTML5 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>November 1, 20164</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px">
	  HTML 5.1 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
	</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px"><b>December 14, 2017</b></p>
	<p style="margin-left: 20px">
	  HTML 5.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation.
	</p>
	<h3 id="transition">Transition of HTML Publication to WHATWG</h3>
	<p align="justify">
	  On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher of the HTML and DOM standards. The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing 
	  competing standards since 2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the standards have since progressively diverged due to 
	  different design decisions. The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the de facto web standard for some time.
	</p>

	<h2 id="markup">Markup</h2>
        <p align="justify">
	  HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character 
	  references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <code>&lth1&gt</code> and <code>&lt/h1&gt</code>, although some 
	  represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example <code>&ltimg&gt</code>. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second 
	  is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  Another important component is the HTML <em>document type declaration</em>, which triggers <em>standards mode</em> rendering.
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  The following is an example of the classic <em>"Hello, World!" program</em>:
	</p>
	<code>
	  <p style="margin-left:5px">&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:5px">&lthtml&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:10px">&lthead&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:15px">&lttitle&gtThis is a title&lt/title&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:10px">&lt/head&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:10px">&ltbody&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:15px">&ltdiv&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:20px">&ltp&gtHello world!&lt/p&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:15px">&lt/div&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:10px">&lt/body&gt</p>
	  <p style="margin-left:5px">&lt/html&gt</p>
	</code>
	<p align="justify">
	  The text between <code>&lthtml&gt</code> and <code>&lt/html&gt</code> describes the web page, and the text between <code>&ltbody&gt</code> and 
	  <code>&lt/body&gt</code> is the visible page content. The markup text <code>&lttitle&gtThis is a title&lt/title&gt</code> defines the browser page 
	  title shown on <em>browser tabs</em> and <em>window</em> titles and the tag <code>&ltdiv&gt</code> defines a division of the page used for easy 
	  styling. Between <code>&lthead&gt</code> and <code>&lt/head&gt</code>, a <code>&ltmeta&gt</code> element can be used to define webpage metadata. 
	</p>
	</p>
	<p align="justify">
	  The Document Type Declaration &lt!DOCTYPE html&gt is for HTML5. If a declaration is not included, various browsers will revert to "<em>quirks 
	  mode</em>" for rendering.
